# game-of-life

This is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life. More just to practice working with Typescript and using Netlify to manage deployments than to do something unique or cool.

More information on the Game of Life [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life#) and [here](https://playgameoflife.com/)

## Basic commands

Pan: drag

Start/Stop: Space

Paint Cells: Ctrl + drag

Erase Cells: Shift + drag

Clear Grid: C

## Patterns

The Game of Life is all about the initial configuration, with some famous patterns available for reference [here](https://playgameoflife.com/lexicon).

The acorn is a pattern that takes over 5,000 generations to stabilize, which is incredibly fun to watch.

The glider is able to perpetually move in one direction forever.

And a glider gun like the Gospel glider gun will generate those gliders forever.
